# Code_Refactor
As the title suggests, my goal for this homework was to refactor the code and make it accessible. Although I didn't need to do much troubleshooting, this project helped reinforce the basics of HTML and CSS. I started by changing DIVs to their proper semantic elements and made sure they were structured apropriatly. 
I also added alt atributes to photos, being careful to only add text to relevant ones. And finally, I commented my code.
